Inheritance:
"is a" relationship between classes
establish relationship between classes - between types
subclass should support every behaviour of the superclass
Liskov's property of substitution:
- should be possible to replace an object of the superclass
	by an object of the subclass
- subclass should support the interface of the superclass

polymorphism:
- many forms
we can replace an object of the superclass by an object of
the subclass - we can invoke a method on the superclass object
- this will be dispatched to the subclass object by which
the superclass object has been replaced
